# InformationExtractionPaper
Abstract: Information Extraction (IE) is a natural language processing (NLP) concept that refers to the task of retrieving information
regarding a topic from a given text. IE turns structured information in texts into structured data. In the past couple of decades, we have observed an exponential increase in the quantity of scientific literature in the biological domain. Although these texts contain useful insights that can help further biomedical research, the process of individually reading and extracting relevant information from each document is an incredibly laborious task. To solve this issue, many efforts have been taken to build IE methods specifically for biological texts. As such, this paper presents an overview of some of the major challenges faced and tools built to use the process of IE in the biological domain.
